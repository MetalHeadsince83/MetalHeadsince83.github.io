         <p>2008, the year Metallica released "Death Magnetic"
          The album featured more complex song structure than St. Anger, 
          including guitar solos and a return to the thrash metal stylings of 
          their first 4 albums. With Death Magnetic, Metallica recalled a 
          classic era without sounding like a parody of themselves.
          The album cover of Metallica's "Death Magnetic" is a subtle design
          with shards of metal arranged in a curious pattern. The album was
          released in 2008 and was produced by Rick Rubin, marking the band's
          first album since "Metallica" (1991) not to be produced by longtime 
          collaborator Bob Rock. The cover art has been described as a tribute 
          to people who have fallen in the music business, with some being drawn
          towards death and others being afraid of it. The album brought more 
          songs like "The Day That Never Comes" and "Unforgiven III" and "Cyanide"</p>
