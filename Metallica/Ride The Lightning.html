        <p>Oh... Good 'ol 1984, the year that Metallica's 
        "Ride The Lightning" released. Ride the Lightning is a Metallica album
        whose title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand,
        in which a character uses the phrase to refer to execution by electric
        chair. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric
        chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The phrase
        "Ride the Lightning" also seemed to describe Metallica's musical 
        approach, and the group soon adopted it as a suitable title for its new
        album This brought more to the table of iconic
        songs like "Ride The Lightning" or "Fade To Black" or "Creeping Death"
        This album had two more songs on it: "Blitzkrieg" and "Am I Evil?" but
        they were taken out and put on
        their album "Garage, Inc." in 1998.</p>
