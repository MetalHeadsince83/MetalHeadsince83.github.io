        <p>1998 was the year Metallica had released "Master Of Puppets"
        The album "Master of Puppets" by Metallica has lyrics that are from the
        point of view of a personification of addiction. The "Master" in the
        title refers to drugs, which control the drug user's life. The lyrics 
        describe the manipulation and control exerted by addiction, with lines
        like "The Master Of Puppets is pulling your strings, twisting your mind
        and smashing your dreams" The album explores the theme of manipulation 
        by "the invisible forces of control that govern all our lives" This album
        brought more heavy hitters like "Battery" "Master Of Puppets" and 
        "Welcome Home (Sanatarium)"</p>
