        <p class="LuxAeterna">We made it, 2023, a whole 7 year wait, Metallica 
        released "72 Seasons" James has said, the album title refers to 
        a human's formative years. A charred cot occupies the centre of the image
        and is surrounded by fire-damaged detritus of a pre-adult life: soft toys,
        a tricycle, wooden toys, a guitar, a baseball bat and a pile of empty cans.
        72 Seasons received generally positive reviews, with critics singling
        out Hetfield's lyricism for praise, though the album's length was
        criticized.</p>
