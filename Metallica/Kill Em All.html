        <p class="KillemAll"> 1983, the year that started it all. Metallica's first album 
        "Kill 'Em All" was released. The album cover for Metallica's "Kill 'Em All" was
        designed by the band themselves. The title was a response to distributors 
        who were trying to censor them. The artwork, done by Gary Heard, depicted 
        blood stains, a sledgehammer, and the shadow of a hand, introducing an element 
        of gore and violence. The album had began Metallica's journey with
        many iconic songs like "Seek And Destroy" or "Motorbreath" or "The Four Horseman" or 
        "Hit The Lights"</p>
