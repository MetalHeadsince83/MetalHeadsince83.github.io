        <p class=""> 1991, the year that kicks of the 90's for Metallica.
        As their first album of the decade "Black Album" was released. The black album
        cover by Metallica was inspired by British rock group Status Quo's album, "Hello!".
        The coiled rattlesnake on the cover and the title for the song "Don't Tread on Me"
        both came from the Gadsden Flag. The album was released in 1991 and had marketing
        considerations due to its color. The album had brought more iconic songs
        like "Enter Sandman" or "The Unforgiven" or "Dont Tread On Me" or 
        "Nothing Else Matters" Fun Fact: The name for this album was originally
        "Married To Metal" This was because two of the members were going through
        divorces, and one was getting married.</p>
